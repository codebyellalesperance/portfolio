    <h2> About Me
    <img src="lemon.png" alt="Description of the image" width="50" height="50" style="vertical-align: middle;"> </h2>
    <p> Hi! I'm a dedicated Computer Science major at Tufts University, 
        graduating in 2025. My academic journey is distinguished by a robust 
        GPA of 3.48 and a comprehensive curriculum that includes Data 
        Structures, Cloud Computing, and Computational Theory. I am 
        proficient in programming languages such as Java, C++/C, and Python, 
        and well-versed in tools like Git, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code.
        <br><br>

        My favorite experience has been with JumboCode at Tufts University,
        where I serve as a Project Manager. In this role, I've led the 
        Agile-driven development for a Boston-based non-profit, Sibling
        Connections, focusing on enhancing volunteer scheduling for events. 
        My responsibilities include overseeing the technical timeline, 
        assigning sprint tasks to developers, 
        and liaising with client leadership to translate requirements into
        actionable solutions. This experience has been vital in 
        honing in on my project management skills and application of 
        real-world software development.
        <br><br>
        
        In my internship at Bain Capital as an IT Finance and Project 
        Management Intern, I significantly improved the firm's computer 
        leasing process, assisted in migrating the firm's intranet to a 
        more efficient platform, and contributed to the deployment of a 
        unified Single Sign-On system. These experiences have helped my 
        understanding of operational efficiency and data-driven 
        decision-making in a corporate setting.
        <br><br>
        
        As a Varsity Lacrosse player at Tufts, I've learned the importance 
        of resilience, teamwork, and balancing a demanding academic and 
        athletic schedule. Mastering the art of juggling the diverse 
        responsibilities inherent in a student athlete's life, and 
        learning to prioritize effectively, are vital skills. These 
        skills not only help you excel in your current role but also lay 
        a strong foundation for success in your future endeavors post-college,
        <br><br> <u>...a journey into the future that I am actively charting at 
                this very moment!</u>
