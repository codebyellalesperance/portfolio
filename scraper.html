            <p class="lede">We examined whether game timing (night vs. day) materially shifts win probability for the New England Patriots using Bayesian methods over multi-year NFL data.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">The Research Question</h2>
                <p>
                    This project started with a simple hypothesis: does playing time affect team performance? More specifically, 
                    we wanted to understand if the New England Patriots had different win probabilities in day games versus 
                    night games, and whether this difference was statistically significant when accounting for other factors 
                    like opponent strength and home field advantage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this might seem like a straightforward question, the statistical complexity lies in properly 
                    accounting for confounding variables and understanding the uncertainty in our estimates. Traditional 
                    frequentist statistics can tell us if there's a significant difference, but Bayesian methods allow 
                    us to quantify our uncertainty and incorporate prior knowledge about the sport.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">The Approach</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Scraped Pro Football Reference for 10 seasons of Patriots game data (2013-2023), including game time, opponent, location, weather conditions, and final scores</li>
                    <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> Built Bayesian logistic regression models to predict win probability, using weakly informative priors and accounting for opponent strength and home field advantage</li>
                    <li><strong>Web Scraping:</strong> Automated data collection using Python and BeautifulSoup to gather comprehensive game statistics from multiple sources</li>
                    <li><strong>Model Validation:</strong> Used cross-validation and posterior predictive checks to ensure model reliability and proper uncertainty quantification</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Technical Implementation</h2>
                <p>
                    The technical implementation involved several sophisticated components. I built a robust web scraping 
                    pipeline using Python and BeautifulSoup to collect data from Pro Football Reference, ESPN, and NFL.com. 
                    The scraper handled rate limiting, error handling, and data cleaning automatically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the statistical analysis, I implemented Bayesian logistic regression models using PyMC3 (now PyMC), 
                    which allowed us to properly quantify uncertainty in our estimates. The model included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Game time effect:</strong> Binary indicator for night vs. day games</li>
                    <li><strong>Opponent strength:</strong> Season-long winning percentage of opponents</li>
                    <li><strong>Home field advantage:</strong> Binary indicator for home vs. away games</li>
                    <li><strong>Weather conditions:</strong> Temperature and precipitation data when available</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The Bayesian approach provided several advantages: we could incorporate prior knowledge about football 
                    (e.g., home field advantage is typically worth 2-3 points), quantify uncertainty in our estimates, 
                    and make probabilistic predictions about future games.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">The Findings</h2>
                <p>
                    Our analysis revealed some interesting patterns, though the results were more nuanced than we initially 
                    hypothesized. The Bayesian model showed that game time did have a measurable effect on win probability, 
                    but the magnitude was smaller than expected.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Night Game Advantage:</strong> The Patriots had a 3.2% higher win probability in night games (95% credible interval: 0.8% to 5.6%)</li>
                    <li><strong>Opponent Strength:</strong> As expected, stronger opponents significantly reduced win probability (coefficient: -0.45, 95% CI: -0.52 to -0.38)</li>
                    <li><strong>Home Field Advantage:</strong> Playing at home increased win probability by 8.7% (95% CI: 6.2% to 11.1%)</li>
                    <li><strong>Weather Effects:</strong> Extreme cold weather (below 20°F) had a small positive effect on win probability</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The Bayesian credible intervals allowed us to make probabilistic statements about the effects. For example, 
                    we could say with 95% confidence that the night game advantage exists and is positive, but we couldn't 
                    rule out that it's smaller than 1% or larger than 6%.
                </p>

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Technical Skills Developed</h2>
                <p>
                    This project pushed my technical skills in several key areas. I gained deep experience with Bayesian 
                    statistics and probabilistic programming, which has applications far beyond sports analytics. The web 
                    scraping component taught me about handling dynamic content, rate limiting, and building robust data 
                    collection pipelines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The statistical modeling required understanding of hierarchical models, prior specification, and 
                    posterior sampling techniques. I also learned about model validation techniques like posterior 
                    predictive checks and cross-validation in the Bayesian context.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">What I Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond the technical skills, this project taught me valuable lessons about research methodology and 
                    statistical thinking. I learned that even seemingly simple questions can have complex statistical 
                    implications, and that proper uncertainty quantification is crucial for drawing meaningful conclusions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bayesian approach was particularly valuable because it forced us to think explicitly about our 
                    prior knowledge and assumptions. Rather than just asking "is there an effect?", we were asking "what 
                    is the magnitude of the effect and how certain are we about it?"
                </p>
