                <h2 class="section-title">The Project</h2>
                <p>
                    This project started with a simple question: how can we help a non-profit organization manage their 
                    volunteers more effectively? Sibling Connections, a Boston-based organization dedicated to supporting 
                    siblings, was struggling with manual volunteer coordination through spreadsheets and email chains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Project and Product Manager, I led a team of 8 developers to create a comprehensive volunteer 
                    scheduling platform. We used Agile methodologies to ensure we were building exactly what the client 
                    needed, when they needed it.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    Sibling Connections faced several key challenges that were impacting their ability to serve their 
                    community effectively:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Manual Processes:</strong> Volunteers were coordinated through spreadsheets and email chains, leading to confusion and missed opportunities</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication Gaps:</strong> Limited visibility into volunteer availability and event needs</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability Issues:</strong> Their growing volunteer base was outpacing their manual management capabilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Event Coordination:</strong> Complex logistics for multiple simultaneous events across different locations</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">My Role</h2>
                <p>
                    As Project and Product Manager, I wore many hats throughout this project:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Team Leadership:</strong> Led 8-person development team using Agile methodologies, established sprint cycles and delivery timelines</li>
                    <li><strong>Client Relations:</strong> Conducted biweekly meetings with client leadership, translated business requirements to technical specifications</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Oversight:</strong> Reviewed architecture decisions, ensured code quality, managed deployment and release cycles</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">The Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    We built a comprehensive platform with several key features:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Volunteer Scheduling:</strong> Intuitive calendar system allowing volunteers to view available slots, sign up for events, and manage their commitments</li>
                    <li><strong>Event Management:</strong> Tools for coordinators to set up events, define requirements, and track volunteer assignments in real-time</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication Hub:</strong> Integrated messaging system facilitating seamless communication between coordinators and volunteers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The platform was built using modern web technologies including React for the frontend, Node.js for the 
                    backend API, and MongoDB for data storage. We implemented responsive design to ensure the platform 
                    worked seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">The Results</h2>
                <p>
                    The impact was immediate and significant:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>75% reduction</strong> in time spent on scheduling and coordination</li>
                    <li><strong>90% volunteer satisfaction</strong> rate with the new system</li>
                    <li><strong>30% improvement</strong> in registration efficiency</li>
                    <li><strong>100% platform uptime</strong> achieved since launch</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Beyond the quantitative metrics, the platform transformed how Sibling Connections operates. They can 
                    now handle more volunteers, coordinate more complex events, and focus their energy on their mission 
                    rather than administrative tasks.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">What I Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    This project taught me invaluable lessons about leading cross-functional teams and managing complex 
                    stakeholder relationships:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Communication is Critical:</strong> Regular, transparent communication with both technical teams and clients prevents scope creep and ensures alignment</li>
                    <li><strong>User Feedback Drives Success:</strong> Early and frequent user testing revealed issues we never would have caught in development</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Leadership:</strong> Balancing technical excellence with business objectives requires strong leadership and decision-making skills</li>
                </ul>
